Where data meets strategy: I'm a Business-Savvy Analyst. And would assist in data-driven decision making, for organizations.

My cross-sector experience (during my Masters & employment in the US, and now in India), helped me to expand my business domain knowledge / familiarity. 

With a Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics from Drexel University(USA) and Bachelors in Investment Management from University of Mumbai (India), I combine strong analytical skills with a holistic understanding of businesses.

On the technical side - I got my proficiencies in PowerBI, Tableau, MS-Excel, SQL, R, Investment Analysis, Data Mining, Business / Market Research, and Developing Presentations; I develop Visually Compelling Dashboards. In a short experience time, I have demonstrated excellence in creating Interactive Dashboards & Reports, that are used for making well-thought decisions by businesses; both, in Digital B2C Space, and Off-line formats. 

I am driven by my commitment to excellence and continuous learning.
